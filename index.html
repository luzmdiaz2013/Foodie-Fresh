                                <p>Frisée
                                    Frisée
                                    Alternate names: Curly endive, chicory, chicory endive, curly chicory
                                    Characteristics: These curled leaves tinged with yellow and green are slightly bitter in taste, have a crunchy stem, and add a lot of texture. Their pale green, white, and yellow coloring is a result of the producer shielding them from light during the growing process. Frisée is closely related to escarole.

                                    Arugula
                                    Arugula
                                    Alternate names: Rocket, Italian cress, Mediterranean rocket, rugola, rugula, roquette, rucola
                                    Characteristics: Possibly the most well-known variety of salad green, arugula forms the basis of many a salad. Originating from the Mediterranean, this green tastes more peppery than bitter and is especially associated with Italian dishes like pesto. The edges of baby arugula aren't as defined.

                                    Alternate names: Chioggia, red chicory, red leaf chicory, red Italian chicory
                                    Characteristics: Pronounced "rah-dick-ee-yo," you can find this deep-red-purple vegetable sold either as a compact round head, as pictured above, or shaped like its relative, endive. The bright coloring makes it stand out. When cooked, the red-purple hue turns brown and what was once bitter becomes sweet.

                                    Mizuna
                                    Mizuna
                                    Alternate names: Japanese greens, spider mustard, xue cai, kyona, potherb mustard, and California Peppergrass
                                    Characteristics: This Japanese mustard green is typically sold as part of a premade salad mix but can be purchased loose at the farmers' market or specialty shop. Mizuna has a relatively strong pungent flavor when compared to other salad greens, but its flavor won't overpower a dish. The small jagged edges that make mizuna look like miniature oak leaves add a lot of texture.

                                    Cress
                                    Characteristics: Pictured is watercress, the most popular type of cress sold in the United States. Other varieties include upland cress, curly cress, and land cress. A peppery taste is characteristic of all varieties. Sold in bunches, watercress has a tough, fibrous stem and small green leaves. Be sure to wash cresses thoroughly, since they often grow in sandy ground.
